A short Python script for fixing .rot files when creating past-to-future animations in GPlates.

Requirements:
  Python 3

Running the rotation fixer (for Windows):
  1) Download and place "main.py" and "Fix_Rotation.bat" into the directory with your Rotations.rot file
  2) Run Fix_Rotation.bat

Note:
  For Linux and MacOS, a .bat does not work. Either execute the Python script manually using the command line or use the OS-equivalent of a .bat file.
